- **Guest OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Host OS:** Windows 11
- **VM User Account:** `jordan-bradfield` (non-root)

## ðŸ›  Recreate the Issue

To reproduce the problem, the following steps were carried out:

1. **Logged into the Ubuntu VM** as the regular user `jordan-bradfield`.
2. Attempted to **edit a protected system file** without `sudo`:
   ```bash
   nano /etc/hosts
   ```
   - Result: Nano opened the file but displayed a warning indicating it was **unwritable**.

3. Attempted to **view the `/etc/shadow` file**, which is restricted:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/shadow
   ```
   - Result: **Permission denied**, confirming lack of root access.

4. Confirmed the session was under the **regular user account**:
   ```bash
   whoami
   ```
   - Output: `jordan-bradfield`

5. Used `sudo` to confirm the user **can escalate privileges** with the correct password:
   ```bash
   sudo ls
   ```
   - Output: Directory contents were listed successfully.

> These tests confirm that the user does not have elevated permissions by default but can access them using `sudo`.

The next step is to verify group memberships, review sudo permissions, and consider hardening user policies.
