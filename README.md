# Real-World IT Ticket Simulation Lab

This project simulates real world IT support tickets to demonstrate hands on problem solving, system diagnostics, and resolution documentation. Each ticket represents a realistic issue encountered in IT environments, from networking errors to user permission problems.

---

## Project Goals

- Practice end-to-end troubleshooting across common IT issues  
- Build a Git-based knowledge base of support incidents  
- Showcase technical support skills through detailed documentation  
- Provide reproducible steps for learning and revision

## Ticket Index

Each markdown file under the `tickets/` folder represents a separate support case.

| Ticket | Issue Description                         | Link |
|--------|--------------------------------------------|------|
| 01     | Network Adapter Disabled – No Connectivity | [View](tickets/01-network-adapter-failure.md) |
| 02     | Snapshot Recovery – Revert Broken System   | [View](tickets/02-snapshot-recovery.md) |
| 03     | Static IP Misconfiguration – No Internet   | [View](tickets/03-static-ip-misconfig.md) |
| 04     | Firewall Blocking Access – UFW Rules       | [View](tickets/04-firewall-blocking.md) |
| 05     | User Permission Denied – Sudo Issue        | [View](tickets/05-user-permission-error.md) |
| 06     | Package Install Fails – Dependency Error   | [View](tickets/06-package-install-fail.md) |

## Skills Demonstrated

- Linux system administration  
- Troubleshooting under pressure  
- Command-line diagnostics  
- Clear and structured technical documentation  
- Version control with Git

## Notes

This is a personal learning lab built to replicate real support scenarios as a solo project. Each scenario is designed to demonstrate initiative and practical knowledge, helping bridge the gap between study and real world IT roles.

## Next Steps

This lab is an evolving project. Upcoming areas of focus will take the troubleshooting scenarios to a more advanced level:

- **Firewall Rules** – Block/allow traffic with UFW (Linux), Windows Firewall, and pfSense. Simulate real user reports like “I can’t access the web server,” then troubleshoot with firewall logs and rules.  
- **VLANs & Routing** – Create isolated virtual networks in VirtualBox, configure routing between VLANs, and simulate inter-departmental traffic restrictions.  
- **VPN Configuration** – Set up a VPN server (e.g., OpenVPN or pfSense) to simulate secure remote access and troubleshoot connection failures.  
- **Active Directory Integration** – Explore Windows domain joins, group policies, and account management tickets.  
- **Cloud Scenarios** – Replicate IT support incidents in AWS/Azure environments for hybrid lab practice.
